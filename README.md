# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-
Tic Tac Toe or populary known as 'X & zero'. This is a fun game made on the Jupyter notebook (.py version is also been attached in the repository)
This is a two player game. This version of the game lets you maintain a score board of the players to determine the winner if the players wish 
to play several game. I hope you enjoy it. Thank you!
